Here is a poem I just came up with:
"Moonlit Dreams"
The night is dark, the stars are bright
A silver glow, a gentle light
The moon is full, its face is wide
A beacon in the dark, a guiding tide
In this quiet hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm, a world to cease
From worries and fears, I am free
Under the moon's gentle melody
The world is hushed, a peaceful sight
A time for dreams, a time for flight
The moon's soft light, a gentle breeze
That whispers secrets, and brings me to my knees
In this moonlit hour, I am alone
Yet connected to the world, a sense of home
A feeling of wonder, a sense of might
A connection to the night, a guiding light.

Here is a poem I just came up with:
"Moonlit Dreams"
The night is dark, the stars are bright
A silver glow, a gentle light
The moon is full, its face is wide
A beacon in the midnight tide
The world is hushed, a peaceful sight
As dreams and magic take flight
The wind whispers secrets in my ear
Of far-off lands and memories dear
In this quiet hour, I find my peace
A sense of calm, a world to cease
From worries and from troubles' sway
I let my spirit drift away
So let the moon shine down on me
And fill my heart with wild liberty
